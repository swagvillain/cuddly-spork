# Tap Tap Racing
Django project for learning/reinforcing arithmetic

## install
User will need to create a python virtual environment in the root directory of the project. User will need to source into it, then install (e.g. using pip) django and pyttsx3. 

May need to run ```sudo apt install epseak-ng``` in order for text-to-speech to work.

Then run the server, and navigate to 
```http://localhost:8000/myapp/```
